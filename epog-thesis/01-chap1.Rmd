# National Systems of Innovation: A theoretical framework for innovation in general

Neoclassical theory do not offer a satisfactory explanation for
innovation in general but specially for radical innovation of the kind
that is necessary for the environmental transition
[@renningsRedefiningInnovationEcoinnovation2000]. In sight of that, this
thesis will build on the literature on evolutionary economics of
innovation [@nelsonEvolutionaryTheoryEconomic1982;
@dosiIntroductionEvolutionaryTheories1994;
@nelsonModernEvolutionaryEconomics2018a] and more specifically
evolutionary approaches to eco-innovation
[@hausknostPoliticsSelectionTransformative2019;
@hazarikaEvolvingTheoriesEcoinnovation2019a;
@renningsTheoryPolicyEcoInnovation1998;
@vandenberghSurvivalGreenestEvolutionary2006].

Evolutionary economics theory drives inspiration from the works of
classical thinkers like Thorstein Veblen [@veblenWhyEconomicsNot1898]
and Joseph Schumpeter [@schumpeterCapitalismSocialismDemocracy1994;
@schumpeterTheoryEconomicDevelopment1980]. The systematic theoretical
framework was later developed, among others, by
@nelsonEvolutionaryTheoryEconomic1982 and
@dosiIntroductionEvolutionaryTheories1994.

One conceptual development derived from the premises set forth by the
evolutionist perspective in economics is the National Innovation Systems
(NIS) framework, which was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s
by @freemanTechnologyPolicyEconomic1987,
@lundvallNationalSystemsInnovation1992, and
@nelsonNationalInnovationSystems1993. A system of innovation is defined
as "a network involving individual and collective processes of
searching, learning, and selection among different innovation
opportunities, including technical and economic dimensions"
[@mckelveyUsingEvolutionaryTheory1997].

According to @freemanNationalSystemInnovation1995, the concept owes a
lot to the works of Friedrich List and Joseph Schumpeter.
@listNationalSystemPolitical1856 developed the concept of "National
System of Political Economy", which, by Freeman's account could as well
have been called "National System of Innovation". Indeed, List
emphasized the importance of "mental capital" and the importance of the
interaction between 'mental capital' and 'material capital', or what we
could call know intangible and tangible capital
[@freemanNationalSystemInnovation1995]. List also recognized the
importance of the industrial sector for economic development, advocating
for the protection of "infant industries" and the attraction of foreign
skilled workers and foreign investment to keep up to date with the most
recent technological advances.

In line with this conception and with the basic principles of
evolutionary economics, the NIS framework is based on a dynamic and
systematic conception of the innovation process. In contrast with the
linear model of innovation in which R&D investments mechanically convert
into innovative outputs, in the NIS framework it ts interactions of the
different actors and the institutions that shape those interactions,
that determine the outcomes of the innovation efforts. Thus, it is an
holistic approach in which "the notion of non-linear and
multidisciplinary innovation processes, and interaction on the
organizational level as well as the interplay between organizations and
institutions are given central interest"
[@balzatRecentTrendsResearch2004]. This holistic perspective "allows for
the inclusion not only of economic factors influencing innovation but
also of institutional, organizational, social, and political factors"
[@edquistSystemsInnovationApproaches1997]. In the same line,
@mckelveyUsingEvolutionaryTheory1997 point out that "seeing innovation
as a collective learning and selection process means it is necessary to
move beyond an analysis of each specific individual innovation and
instead examine collective learning and aggregate patterns of innovative
activities, both processes and outcomes.".

There is not a single definition of a National Innovation System. For
instance @balzatRecentTrendsResearch2004 defines it as "a historically
grown subsystem of the national economy in which various organizations
and institutions interact with and influence one another in the carrying
out of innovative activity"; while for
@patelNationalInnovationSystems1994 it is "the national institutions,
their incentive structures and their competencies, that determine the
rate and direction of technological learning (or the volume and
composition of change-generating activities) in a country" and
@schrempfNationalRegionalSectoral2013 considers it to be "a group of
private firms,  public research institutes, and several of the
facilitators of innovation, who in interaction promote the creation of
one or a number of technological  innovations [within  a  framework 
of]  institutions...  which promote or facilitate the diffusion or
application of these technological innovations [...]".

The NIS has been criticized for being too vague
[@edquistSmallCountryInnovation2008]. However, for
@lundvallNationalInnovationSystems2007a, the relative vagueness of the
NIS concept allows it to serve as a "focusing device", that helps to
"understand and control phenomena that could not be seen, understood or
controlled without using this (or a similar) concept". Thus he argues
for a broad conception of the NIS and considers unnecessary to embark in
a theorizing effort. @edquistSmallCountryInnovation2008 on the other
hand, argue that "there is therefore a need for theoretically based
empirical research to 'straighten up' the approach and make it more
'theory-like'". In this thesis, I take a broad understanding of the NIS,
in the sense of including not only the more traditional elements (firms,
Universities, research centres, and their interactions), but also social
and political factors. In this sense, the NIS is more a focusing device
in the conception of @lundvallNationalInnovationSystems2007a, than a
fully-developed theory as proposed by
@edquistSmallCountryInnovation2008.

In this thesis I will understand a system as constituted by a number of
elements and by the relationships between these elements, which give
rise to emergent properties, i.e. the whole is grater than the sum of
the individual parts. Therefore, I assume
@lundvallLearningEconomyEconomics2016 definition that "a system of
innovation is constituted by elements and relationships that interact in
the production, diffusion and use of new and economically useful
knowledge and that a national system encompasses elements and
relationships, either located or rooted inside the borders of a nation
state".

Apart from its vagueness, one main critique to the NIS approach is it
focus on 'national' frameworks, that is, the boundaries if
nation-states, in a context of growing globalization and transnational
companies that produce a significant part of the innovative outputs
without strong links to any particular nation-state. The main
counterargument comes from @porterCompetitiveAdvantageNations1998:
"competitive advantage is created and sustained through a highly
localised process. Differences in national economic structures, values,
cultures, institutions and histories contribute profoundly to
competitive success. The role of the home nation seems to be as strong
or stronger than ever. While globalisation of competition might appear
to make the nation less important, instead it seems to make it more so.
With fewer impediments to trade to shelter uncompetitive domestic firms
and industries, the home nation takes on growing significance because it
is the source of the skills and technology that underpin competitive
advantage". Porter's argument becomes even more relevant in the context
of reshoring and other "deglobalization" trends that seem to be gaining
momentum in international trade and value chains
[@kamakuraGlobalisingRegionalisingReshoring2022].

It should also be stresses that several approaches have been developed
that take the systemic nature of innovation and apply it to systems
other than the nation-state. The regional innovation systems and the
sectoral innovation systems are two instances of those developments. The
main concepts remain the same, but the application is restricted to
different "units of analysis". These approaches complement rather
exclude each other [@edquistSystemsInnovationTechnologies1997]. In this
thesis, I combine the national and sectoral approaches. The unit of
analysis is still the nation-state, but the target is to understand how
a combination of national and sectoral institutions (in the broad sense
of the word) affect the output of a particular sector or "technological
domain" [@schrempfNationalRegionalSectoral2013], i.e. the environmental
technologies sector.

## Innovation: the Schumpeterian legacy

In the NIS approach, innovation is conceptualized very much in a
Schumpeterian way, as "the commercial realization or introduction of a
new product, process or system in the economy"
[@freemanTechnologicalInfrastructureInternational2004] or simply as "new
combinations" [@lundvallNationalInnovationSystems2007a]. In any case,
innovation is considered as the product of complex processes n which
firms play the most important role, but are constrained by the
institutional setting, and by their relations with each other and with
the environment. According @edquistSystemsInnovationTechnologies1997,
innovation processes are "characterized by complicated feedback
mechanisms and interactive relations involving science, technology,
learning, production, policy, and demand". In a complex system,
sometimes different elements converge to create "technological
opportunities" [@geelsTechnologicalTransitionsEvolutionary2002;
@lundvallNationalInnovationSystems2007a;
@lundvallLearningEconomyEconomics2016]. These opportunities are seized
by firms that can produce alternative technological solution, creating
variety. Selective pressures will then will make some of those
alternatives "survive", while other will not. Surviving technologies
become incumbents and might generate path dependencies and
(technological and institutional) lock-ins. By
@nelsonBringingInstitutionsEvolutionary2002 account "At any given period
of time, many of the routines are largely common to firms in the same
line of business, but some are not, and these latter, therefore, provide
the stuff that determines how firms do relative to their competitors".

@nelsonBringingInstitutionsEvolutionary2002 considers that the notion of
a national or sectoral innovation system is "an institutional concept
par excellence". This is relevant in the context of this thesis since
the main determinants of environmental innovation are assumed to be
institutional, in the form of a complex and not additive relation
between innovation infrastructure, environmental policy, and legal and
political strength. However, there is theoretical caveat, since
institutions, by their own nature, tend to create stability and inertial
forces, which could collide with the change (sometimes abrupt) that
innovation brings to the system. In particular, it is possible that
incumbents use institutional mechanisms to avoid the entrance of
newcomers [@groenewegenEvolutionNationalInnovation2006]. However,
institutions might also create incentives for innovators and a stable
institutional environment might also favor diffusion and adoption of
innovations. Indeed, institutions are one of the main channels for
introducing innovation into organizations
[@venturaRoleInstitutionsAchieving2020]. Therefore it is necessary to
recognize that institutions may have mixed effects on innovation, and
the balance may depend upon other variables and change with time
[@edquistSystemsInnovationTechnologies1997]. In this thesis, we try to
identify the institutional settings that favors innovation of
environmental technologies, which require, as discussed later, to break
the path-dependence of fossil fuel and other "dirty" technologies.

One of the main challenges of the NIS approach is to operationalize it
so that it can be an useful for empirical research. This challenge has
been recognized by one of the proponents of the concept: "This emphasis
on the complex relations between elements constitutes a major advantage
of the systems of innovation approach. However, it also constitutes a
challenge; we simply do not know enough about these relations. It is
important to be able to capture these interdependencies in empirical
work -which includes the development of concepts and indicators that
relate elements to each other
[@edquistSystemsInnovationTechnologies1997]. Also, as mentioned by
@andersenGreeningInnovationSystems2009, rather than suggesting that
innovation is dependent on everything, the broad perspective of the
national innovation system aims to pinpoint the key actors and
institutions that have the greatest impact on the innovation process and
economic growth.

The early literature on National Innovation Systems consisted on case
studies without any serious comparative attempt. For example the title
of @nelsonNationalInnovationSystems1993a book, "National Innovation
Systems: A Comparative Analysis", may be well considered misleading,
since it is a collection of case studies without an unifying conceptual
base and no comparative effort. The National Innovation System section
in the anthology by @dosiTechnicalChangeEconomic1988, has the same case
study model; empirical regularities were not considered at this stage.

@edquistSmallCountryInnovation2008 present the first attempt to a
comparative study using a common conceptual framework to analyze both
the "propensity to innovate" and the determinants that help explain such
propensity to innovate in a set of small countries in Asia and Europe.
In their words, a "systematic identification of such determinants of
innovation processes is a surprisingly under-researched area in
innovation studies" [@edquistSmallCountryInnovation2008].

The determinants that they use are similar to the ones used later in the
NIC approach (see next section), including R&D activities, provision of
competences through education and training, institutional arrangements
regarding patent and tax laws, and environmental regulations), however,
they are established *a priori* instead of tested against the empirical
evidence. In that sense, the volume is still not a systematic
comparative study, but a collection of case studies with a common (or
similar) structure. The data sources are heterogeneous and there is no
attempt to draw general inferences about the weight and scope of the
determinants of the propensity to innovate.

## Sectoral systems of innovation

Since this thesis deals with one particular technology domain, that of
environmental technologies, it is relevant to present the main ideas of
the Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) approach. Indeed, the general
framework is the same of NIS, just applied to a particular industrial
sector or technological domain.

The main conceptual contribution is the notion of sector, which is
defined as "a set of activities which are unified by some related
product groups for a given or emerging demand and which share some basic
knowledge" [@malerbaSectoralSystemsInnovation2005]. Just like in the
NIS, the SIS is based on the idea that innovative firms create variety
in technologies, products, and organisations; followed by processes of
replication and processes of selection.

The firms within a sector have commonalities as well as differences; but
in general they are constrained by the environmental conditions of the
sector, that is, how the sector is regulated, the knowledge base, the
state of technology, the imputs, the demand conditions (existing or
potential), and the interactions with other firms and with that
environment. All of those conditions create an institutional setting
with routines and regularities. @malerbaSectoralSystemsInnovation2005
points out that "a lot of institutions are national (such as the patent
system), while others may be specific to sectoral systems, such as
sectoral labour markets or sector-specific financial institutions".
Since institutions are usually highly idiosyncratic, the same
institution may take on different features in different countries, and
therefore have different effects on innovation.

On the other hand, different institutions within a single country can
have different and even contrasting effects on the innovative capacity
of a particular sector. In the case of the sector of environmental
technologies, usually there are lock-ins created by path dependencies in
the innovation system that tend to perpetuate innovation in "brown"
technologies As mentioned by @kempRegimeShiftsSustainability1998 "Firms
vested in the old technologies will be more inclined to reformulate
their existing products than do something radically new that may involve
a great risk to the firm". Environmental policy therefore has the role
of breaking this lock-in, by generating the incentives for firms to
innovate in green technologies. However, "radically new technologies
[like those required for the green transition] require changes in both
the supply and demand sides, which usually take time and meet
resistance, even inside the organization in which they are produced"
[@kempRegimeShiftsSustainability1998].

## National Innovative Capacity

One major development of the NIS theory's empirical strength comes from
the National Innovative Capacity (NIC) model. There are several
challenges when trying to measure a complex concept like the NSI. The
NIC approach tries to find the most appropriate indicators, no only of
inputs and outputs (like in a linear model), but also on interactions
and links between actors, and institutional setting. As mentioned by
@balzatRecentTrendsResearch2004 "The NIC model can be considered as an
ingenious contribution to the NIS approach, because it builds a bridge
between elements of economic growth theory and a modern, systemic
approach to innovation, which is extended by a (nondescriptive)
technique to carry out international comparisons of innovative
strength". It focuses on evaluating how innovation varies with
country-level policy specificity, using an econometric model based on an
internationally comparable set of indicators.

Their empirical framework takes on the challenge identified by
@edquistSystemsInnovationTechnologies1997 that "quantification is
important. This is needed for the development of a more sophisticated
systemic and interactive view of innovation processes. It is, however,
not an easy task. More work is needed on identification of the central
elements in systems of innovation, estimating their relative importance,
as well as investigating the relations between them."

The NIC model was developed by
@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002. These authors define National
Innovative Capacity as "the ability of a country -- as both a political
and economic entity -- to produce and commercialize a flow of innovative
technology over the long term"
[@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002]. According to
@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002 there are three main
theoretical sources for their NIC framework: "(1) theories of
ideas-driven growth [@romerEndogenousTechnologicalChange1990]; (2)
microeconomic models of national competitive advantage and industrial
clusters [@porterCompetitiveAdvantageNations1998]; and (3) the
literature on national innovation systems
[@nelsonNationalInnovationSystems1993]". I argue that the key components
of the ideas-driven growth and the industrial clusters are also
developed and incorporated in a comprehensive approach of the NIS such
as that which informs this thesis, and as such, the NIC can be actually
considered as a derivation or even an empirical application of the NIS.

In their empirical model, @furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002
divide their indicators into three categories. The first one is that of
the "common innovation infrastructure". This includes all the elements
that affect the general level on innovation performance at the national
level, such as the technological sophistication and the stock of skills.
The "cluster-specific innovation environment" indicators rest on the
notion that "the innovative performance of an economy ultimately rests
on the behavior of individual firms and clusters"
[@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002]. This notion can be equated
in the case of this work to the environmental regulations that affect in
particular the 'sectoral cluster' of environmental technologies firms.

The third notion of the NIC framework is the quality of the linkages. To
explain it, @furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002 actually takes the
example of environmental innovations: "the ability of the Swedish
cluster to generate and commercialize environmental innovations depends
on the overall availability of trained scientists and engineers, access
to basic research, and overall policies which reward the development and
commercialization of new technologies in the economy".

The importance of the NIC framework comes not mainly from its
*quantitative*, but from its *comparative* nature, which is also the
main advantage for this thesis. Indeed, the main interest of this work
is to observe the factors that influence the green innovative capacity,
so that they can inform policy and serve as benchmarks. That can be
better achieved using a comparative approach instead of case-studies. As
mentioned by @moroNationalInnovativeCapacity2019 "NIC analytical
framework can therefore be used to contrast innovation capacities from
country to country since it provides the basis for a quantitative
analysis using a different set of indicators allowing international
comparisons. In this context, the ability to develop cross-country
comparisons is extremely important for investigating why countries
present different innovative capacities".

However, the NIC is only a base that should be adapted to encompass the
particularities of a environmental innovation capacity. Therefore, for
the empirical work of this thesis, I use a modified version of the NIC,
based on the works of @andrijauskieneRedevelopingNationalInnovative2021
and others. In particular, in addition to the indicators used by
@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002 and
@porterNationalInnovativeCapacity2002, I include two new sets of
indicators: (1) Those related specifically to the sectoral environmental
policies that should affect the 'sectoral system' of environmental
innovation, as explained above; and (2) Social and political factors
that shape both the innovation environment and the capacity of the State
to actually enforce environmental policies and regulations, which
influences the incentive structure for firms to adopt green
technologies.

Since innovation processes are interactive, I give high importance to
the nature and quality of the interactions and linkages between
different parts of the innovation system (Universities, firms,
consumers, etc.). This is, however, one of the most difficult concepts
to operationalize empirically. @furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002
uses two indicators, higher education and venture capital. In this
thesis, I drop the venture capital because the data is not very reliable
for my sample and because in the analysis of
@furmanDeterminantsNationalInnovative2002 it does not appear to be
significant, and rely on proxies like the share of Higher Education R&D
financed by the business sector. More details are provided in the
Methodology section.

## Environmental Innovation

There is not a consensual definition of environmental innovation or its
synonyms (eco-innovation, green innovation). Today, probably the most
accepted definition is that proposed by @kempFinalReportMEI2007 as part
of the MEI5 project, as the "Assimilation or exploitation of a product,
production process, service or management or business method that it is
novel to the firm or user and which results, throughout its life cycle,
in a reduction of environmental risk, pollution and other negative
impacts of resources use (including energy use) compared to relevant
alternatives".

In the case of this thesis, I am interested in particular in the drivers
of environmental innovation, a topic that has generated a growing body
of literature. A great part of this literature focuses on the impact of
environmental policy on innovation, at an aggregate (national) level
[@borsattoGreenInnovationUnfolding2019; @brunelGreenInnovationGreen2019;
@carraroEnvironmentalPolicyReconsidered1994;
@delriogonzalezEmpiricalAnalysisDeterminants2009;
@gerlaghLinkingEnvironmentalInnovation2008;
@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997;
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995]. A second strand
looks at the micro level, analyzing firm behavior or particular sectors
(automotive, energy)
[@brunnermeierDeterminantsEnvironmentalInnovation2003;
@geeEcoInnovationSystemsProblem2011;
@horbachDeterminantsEnvironmentalInnovation2008]. However, there is very
few empirical literature on how environmental policy interacts with the
innovation environment and the more broadly institutional framework to
promote green innovation. Originally, most of the studies focus on
single countries and only more recently some literature has adopted a
comparative and international approach
[@poppEnvironmentalPolicyInnovation2019].

This section provides an overview of the theoretical contributions and
empirical findings in the literature on environmental innovation and
will present the developments on the evolutionary perspective of green
innovation that will guide this work.

### Approaches to environmental innovation

Traditionally, environmental innovation has been framed in the
neoclassical perspective, in which rational, utilitarian actors "are
preoccupied with short run allocative questions leading to equilibrium"
[@andersenGreeningInnovationSystems2009] in perfect competition. In this
perspective, environmental problems are framed in the market failure
theory. In particular, in the neoclassical framework, environmental
innovation is subject to a "double externality" problem. Innovation in
general is known to generate spill-overs that are cannot be fully
internalized my markets themselves (therefore the rationale for R&D
subsidies, patents, and other appropriation mechanisms). The special
character of eco-innovation processes is that they develop products and
services which themselves cause external (environmental) benefits
[@renningsRedefiningInnovationEcoinnovation2000]. The double externality
problem thus leads to a justification of an eco-innovation policy only
in a transition period, until the externalities can be fully
internalized.

Most of the literature within the neoclassical framework has studied the
role of policy in addressing those twin externalities, analyzing at at
macro level the impact of R&D subsidies and innovation promotion
policies on the one hand, and carbon taxes, tradable permits, and in
general the stringency of environmental policy on the other
[@poppChapter21Energy2010]. A number of papers have dedicated to testing
the "Porter's hypothesis" proposed by
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995, that simply put
states that "properly designed environmental standards can trigger
innovation that may partially or more than fully offset the costs of
complying with them"
[@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995].

The Porter Hypothesis takes two versions
[@poppEnvironmentalPolicyInnovation2019], the weak version hypothesizes
that environmental stringent policy spurs environmental innovation;
while the strong version hypothesizes that new innovation spurred by
environmental regulation is sufficient to offset the costs of such
regulation, so that the general productivity of firms on the regulated
sector can actually increase after the regulation takes place. Many
studies have tested both versions, often reaching different conclusions.
For instance @francoEffectWithinSectorUpstream2017 found support for
both the weak and string versions of the Porter Hypothesis. On a large
meta-analysis, @cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018 points out that,
in general, there has been strong support for the weak version, but more
controversy has surrounded the strong version, with most studies in the
1990s suggesting a negative impact of environmental constrains on
productivity; but and some suggestions of positive effects more
recently. They also find more support for the Porter Hypothesis at the
state, regional or country level than at the firm or industry level.

As evidenced by @poppEnvironmentalPolicyInnovation2019, in general, many
of those studies make the assumption of linearity, i.e., that policy
interventions have a direct consequence on *inducing* innovation, and do
not consider the systemic nature of innovation as laid out supra, for
example through a careful consideration of the complex interactions
between different policies and institutions.

In the evolutionary theory that informs this work, things are more
complex. Path dependencies, lock-ins, institutional rigidities,
imperfect knowledge and transaction costs should be taken into account
[@renningsTheoryPolicyEcoInnovation1998]. All those things considered,
there is a strong case for an intervention from Governments to control
the rate and direction of the technological change in the environmental
sector. As mentioned by @veugelersWhichPolicyInstruments2012, "in view
of the pervasive combination of environmental and knowledge
externalities characterizing clean innovations, the private clean
innovation machine cannot be expected to be socially effective on its
own".

As mentioned by @andersenGreeningInnovationSystems2009, there are four
concepts from the perspective of innovation systems thinking that hold
particular relevance to this thesis. These include the notion of 'system
failures', the focus on path dependence and cumulative causation, the
significance of connecting sectoral or specialization analyses with
national and global analyses, and the comprehension of long-term
industrial dynamics and transformation.

The main challenge from the point of view of evolutionary economics is
how to ignite the engine of green innovation in the face of the fact
that "new clean technologies face competition from the existing more
dirty technologies, who enjoy an initial installed base advantage"
[@veugelersWhichPolicyInstruments2012], and more in general "support for
incumbent technologies is often institutionalised within the rules of
the regimes making it difficult for innovations to break through"
[@kivimaaCreativeDestructionMere2016].

To understand why this is so, it is necessary to introduce the concept
of "technological regime" introduced by
@nelsonEvolutionaryTheoryEconomic1982. The basic idea is that there are
routines and beliefs of what is possible and what is feasible that are
shared by a community of engineers and entrepreneurs, which form a
technological regime. Technological regimes then shape technological
development creating stability and steering the innovative activity
towards incremental innovation. So that it is not only environmental
technologies, but in general radical new technologies that have a
difficulty to break through, because the institutional structure of the
innovation system evolved to support the old regime
[@geelsTechnologicalTransitionsEvolutionary2002].

The derivation of this is has given rise to whole stream of literature
about how to destabilize those regimes and allow for radical innovation,
including green technologies. Among others, strategic niche management
(SNM) is a way for policy-makers to manage the transition between
technological regimes. SNM involves the change in the structure of
(institutional) incentives in which markets operate, so as to affect
both the supply and the demand factors in a quest to create societal
technological shifts in a reasonable period of time. Managing those
innovation niches require bringing together different actors
(universities, firms, public and private research institutes, financial
organizations) to work on a common objective, aligning their incentives
for instance by securing the future demand for a new product by public
procurement mechanism [@kempRegimeShiftsSustainability1998].

The transition to a green economy poses a societal challenge that goes
way beyond its technological component; but technology has to be aligned
with the deeper socio-historical transformation. There is a need for
policy to create the right incentives and steer the technological
development in the direction of sustainability, "aiming at 'unlocking' a
socio-technical system to provide opportunities for alternative, more
sustainable systems to develop and diffuse"
[@faberModelsEvolutionaryEconomics2009]". Doing so requires what
@kivimaaCreativeDestructionMere2016 has called "disruptive policy mixes
aiming for systemic change", challenging the lock-ins and fostering a
transition in the technological regime.

In sight of that, this thesis evaluates a range of variables across
policy domains, including not only the environmental and innovation
policies, but also the broader legal and political conditions that are
required for a transition to a clean environmental technology regime, as
potential drivers of new-to-the-world environmental technologies.
